# LFPUBS

The proposed system, Learning Frequent Patterns of User Behaviour System (LFPUBS), is based on a three-layered architecture that takes into account all aspects related to the learning process. This system has been used to discover patterns of user's behaviours and represent them in a comprehensible way. The core of the representation module is a language (LLFPUBS) that provides a standard conceptualization of the patterns so that the environment is able to represent all type of patterns that can occur in the environment. The process of discovering is based on an algorithm (ALFPUBS) that takes into account for characteristics of the Intelligent Environments’ attempts to discover frequent patterns.

This system has been modified in order to automate IE and connect with M-reasoner.
